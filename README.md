The project was built using Java as the OOP language. Java Swing was used for the UI. The relational Database PostgreSQL was used to achieve persistence. PostgreSQL also manages concurrency automatically. Please note that Maven was used to manage dependencies, and was needed to integrate PostgreSQL with the project. Maven is a build tool, not a framework. 

If you wish to run the project, we recommend using JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. You will need to run the project as a Maven project. Please email sevag.merdkhanian@gmail.com if you run into any issues.
